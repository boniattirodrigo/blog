**Hi folks!** I absolutely love TED Talks, I'm always watching them when I've some free time, so today I'll be sharing with you my top 5 favourites TED Talks.

My first is **Massive-scale online collaboration** by Luis von Ahn, it shows how we can make a difference in the world with simple ideas and doing little things. [Check out](https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration).

Second. Elon Musk is an awesome man, he really makes fantastic things, in this video he speaks about his companies and how he does to innovate every time. **The mind behind Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity**. [Link](https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_mind_behind_tesla_spacex_solarcity).

Third. **A passionate, personal case for education**, by Michelle Obama, I a love fantastic life history, on this one Michelle talks about her childhood and how education has the power to transform it. [Take a look](http://www.ted.com/talks/michelle_obama).

Fourth. **The agony of trying to unsubscribe**. I like this one because James Veitch is such a funny guy! He is spot on about email marketing companies. [See](https://www.ted.com/talks/james_veitch_the_agony_of_trying_to_unsubscribe).

And now, the last but not least, **Do schools kill creativity?** It's most famous TED Talk of all time, if you kill creativity, you also kill dreams, passion, and love for education. [Worth to see](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity).
